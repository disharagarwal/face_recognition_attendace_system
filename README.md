It covers areas such as facial detection,recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new employees, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time and attendance digitally.
